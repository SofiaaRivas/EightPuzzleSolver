# EightPuzzleSolver
This program provides a solution for a scrambled 8-puzzle by implementing various AI gameplaying concepts. The program reads in puzzle state configurations from a text file and uses one of 3 different search algorithms to provide the solution steps. 

**Features:**
The search algorithms implemented are:
- BFS
- DFS
- A-star search with two distinct heuristics

  Branching factor analysis
  - Computes the branching factor of the search algorithm
